# ShopifyBackendInternChallenge2022

Hello, my name is Henry O'Scannlain-Miller.  This is my submission for the Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge.  For my extra feature, I have developed an export to CSV functionality.


To run my application, first start the server, then run the front end.

## Server (inside /server):
1. To install: "npm init"
2. To run "node server.js"

## Client (inside /client/frontend):
1. To install "npm init"
2. To run "npm start"
