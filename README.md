# ShopifyBackendInternChallenge2022

Hello, my name is Henry O'Scannlain-Miller.  This is my submission for the Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge.  For my extra feature, I developed an export to CSV button.

I built my application using node.js and the express framework on the backend, and react on the frontend.
In order to run this application, node, npm, and react must be installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)
To run my application, first start the server, then run the frontend.

## Server (inside /server):
1. To install dependencies: "npm init"
2. To run "node server.js"

## Client (inside /client/frontend):
1. To install dependencies: "npm init"
2. To run "npm start"

As explained in the comments, I used a dictionary to store the data on the server so that you would not need to configure a database to test my app.  In the past, I have built similar projects with PostgreSQL, an example of which is here https://github.com/chasebrownn/bidoff.
